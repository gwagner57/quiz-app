# Online Quiz App
A JS/LocalStorage and CloudFlare Workers KV app for online quizzes

The basic version supports multiple-choice questions only, while the full version also supports short answer questions, numeric answer questions and gap fill questions. 

The questions of a quiz, and the answer options of a multiple-choice question, should always be presented in a random order (shuffled).

The app's default language for text items is EN.
