    <title>Quiz App Design</title>

  <body><h1>Quiz App Design</h1><p>The quiz app is based on a database that
  contains multi-lingual quiz questions. The basic version of the app consists
  of three parts:</p><ol>
      <li>A component that allows selecting a file in the Moodle XML question
      format and uploads the questions (with type="multichoice" or
      "shortanswer" or "numerical") to the app's database.</li>

      <li>A component that allows selecting a quiz from the database and then
      creates/renders a static webpage (HTML document) containing the entire
      quiz (questions with answer options)</li>

      <li>A front-end component that allows a user taking a quiz by loading a
      quiz webpage. This includes providing a quiz clock and a feed-back page
      after the quiz has been completed and evaluated (on the front-end
      computer). During the quiz, a <em>quiz performance</em> record collects,
      for each multiple-choice question, a set of sequence numbers of the
      chosen answer options, allowing to evaluate/grade the user's quiz
      performance.</li>
    </ol><p>The basic version is to support multiple-choice questions, short
  answer questions and numeric answer questions. The questions of a quiz, and
  the answer options of a multiple-choice question, should always be presented
  in a random order (shuffled).</p><p>The app's default language for text
  items is EN.</p><h2>Database Schema</h2><p>The DB has the following tables
  (called "collections" in Firestore):</p><p><b>quizzes</b></p><ul>
