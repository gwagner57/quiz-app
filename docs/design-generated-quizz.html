    <title>Quizz App Design</title>
  </head>

  <body><h1>Quizz App Design</h1><p>The quiz app is based on a Firestore Cloud
  database that contains multi-lingual quiz questions with answer options. The
  basic version of the app consists of three parts:</p><ol>
      <li>A component that allows selecting a file in the Moodle XML question
      format and uploads the questions (with type="multichoice" or
      "shortanswer" or "numerical") to the app's Firestore DB.</li>

      <li>A component that allows selecting a quiz from the Firestore DB and
      then creates/renders a static HTML page containing the entire quiz data
      (questions with answer options)</li>

      <li>A front-end component that allows a user taking a quiz on the basis
      of a static HTML page. This includes providing a quiz clock and a
      feed-back page after the quiz has been completed and evaluated. During
      the quiz, a <em>quiz performance</em> record collects, for each
      multiple-choice question, a set of sequence numbers of the chosen answer
      options, allowing to evaluate/grade the user's quiz performance. </li>
    </ol><p>The basic version is to support multiple-choice questions, short
  answer questions and numeric answer questions. The questions of a quiz, and
  the answer options of a multiple-choice question, should always be presented
  in a random order (shuffled).</p><p>The app's default language for text
  items is EN.</p><h2>Database Schema</h2><p>The Firestore DB has the
  following tables ("collections"):</p><p><b>quizzes</b></p><ul>
